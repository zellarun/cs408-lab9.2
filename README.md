# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

This Lab is a user interactive animation built with HTML and JavaScript. It is a simple game of colorful balls that bounce around the browser window. The evil circle is what the user can move with their mouse to eat the balls by touching them. Each time a ball is eaten the on-screen ball count decreases until all the balls are gone.
